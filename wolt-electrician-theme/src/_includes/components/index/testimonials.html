          The repair work itself was done efficiently and with the utmost care.
          I appreciated how they were meticulous about safety, ensuring all
          electrical components were installed correctly and up to code. I felt
          confident that the job was done right the first time. Moreover, the
          electrician's rates were fair and transparent. I didn't feel like I
          was being taken advantage of, and I received excellent value for the
          money I spent. They even offered tips on how to maintain my electrical
          system to prevent future issues, which I found incredibly helpful.
